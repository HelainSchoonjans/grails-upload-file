The `uploadFeatureImage` controller's action uses the previously described command
object to validate the upload form submission. If it does not find validation errors, it invokes a service.

We configure the local server url which will host the uploaded images and the local
folder path where we are going to save the images to.

Service uses the `transferTo` method to transfer the file to a local file path.
In case of error, the service deletes the file it has previously transfered

[source, groovy]
./grails-app/services/example/grails/UploadPointOfInterestFeaturedImageService.groovy

include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/example/grails/UploadPointOfInterestFeaturedImageService.groovy[]

The service updates `featuredImageUrl` with the help of a GORM Data Service:

./grails-app/services/example/grails/PointOfInterestDataService.groovy
